PolyMint is the way for artist to upload their art without needing to pay for minting or transactions,
enabling collectors to pay for the first mint of a collection. By leveraging PolyMint we aim to make artists
access tokenizing their art without friction.
</p>
<p className="text-center mb-2 px-20">
The first minter of a collection, who pays for cost of the deployment of the NFT contract, gets a share of the
royalties of all the NFTs minted in that collection. This creates a market for art investors being eager to
first mint a piece of art they like.
</p>
<p className="text-center mb-2 px-20">
The cost of the deployment consists in the gas cost of the deployment transaction, and a custom optional USDC
commision set by the artist that gets distributed 90% for the artist and 10% for the marketplace.
